      While the nation seems on the verge of full marriage
      equality, most states still have not adopted
      non-discrimination laws protecting LGBT people.

      This interactive explores the increased disparities that
      LGBT people face who live in the states without state
      sexual orientation non-discrimination laws.Â  More than
      60% of LGBT Americans live in the South, Midwest and
      Mountain states, where they face a more challenging
      social climate and legal landscape and have greater dispar-
      ities when compared to non-LGBT people across a number
      of economic and health indicators.

      Please click on the visuals in this interactive to explore
      more of the data.
