                    <h1><a>Introduction</a></h1>

                    <p>Public opinion on LGBT issues has shifted over the years.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- graph of opinions on marriage/employment/sin -->
                    <p>Meanwhile, statewide employment protections have stagnated. In the last 5 years, no new states have passed laws protecting LGBT employees from discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- timeline map of employment laws -->

                    <p>The 29 states that do not provide protections largely cluster in the South, Midwest, and Mountain regions of the country.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Current employment map with region overlay. -->

                    <p>Employment protections and regional differences are impacting the educational, economic, and health realities of LGBT people.</p>

                <div class="ethnicity chapter">
                    <h1><a>Ethnicity</a></h1>

                    <p>A majority of the LGBT population lives in the South, Midwest, and Mountain regions of the country.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Region map with % LGBT population overlay -->

                    <p>In each region, the LGBT population largely reflects the same race/ethnic breakdown as the non-LGBT population.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Pie charts of race/ethnicity by region -->

                    <p>However, when looking at the race/ethnic breakdown in the 21 states compared to the 29 states, African-American LGBT individuals are more likely to live in the 29 states that do not offer employment protections. About 900,000 LGBT people living in states without employment protections are African-American.</p>

                <div class="education chapter">
                    <h1><a>Education</a></h1>

                    <p>Researchers have hypothesized that LGBT people may intentionally pursue higher education as a way to buffer themselves against discrimination in the workplace.</p>

                    <p>As it stands, LGBT individuals maintain higher levels of college completion in the 21 protective states than in the 29 states where they might need education to prevent discrimination the most.</p>
                    <!-- <a class="show-me"></a> -->
                    <!-- Bar chart of college completion by 21/29 -->

                    <p>The Midwest region reports the lowest rates of college completion among LGBT people. The Mountain and Southern states are not too far behind.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Bar chart of college completion by region -->

                    <p>The Midwest is also one of the only regions where non-LGBT individuals are more likely to have a college degree than their LGBT counterpart.</p>

                    <h1><a>Economic Insecurity</a></h1>

                    <p>More LGBT people report household incomes below $24,000 than non-LGBT people.</p>

                    <p>Poverty gaps are at their highest in the Midwest and Mountain states, where LGBT individuals are almost 1.5 times more likely to have incomes below $24,000 than non-LGBT people.</p>

                    <!-- Bar chart of <$24,000 by region & ss/ds -->

                    <p>LGBT people also consistently report not having enough money for food at higher rates than non-LGBT people. Particularly in the Mountain and Southern states.</p>

                    <h1><a>Health</a></h1>

                    <p>Across the U.S., LGBT people report significant financial constraints on health care. This is particular true for Midwest, Mountain and Southern states.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Bar chart of no money for healthcare by region & ss/ds -->

                    <p>Given higher rates of poverty, food insecurity and lack of money for healthcare, it is not surprising that LGBT people in these regions are also less likely to have health insurance.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                    <!-- Bar chart of health insurance by region & ss/ds -->

                    <h1><a>Conclusion</a></h1>

                    <p>Legal and social differences across the states and regions are likely both the cause and effect of the disparities in economics, education and health.</p>

                    <p>While Southern LGBT people do face disparities compared to there non-LGBT counterparts, our analyses found that many of the greatest disparities are found in the Midwest and Mountain states.</p>

                    <p>The social climate of each region has its own assets and challenges to achieving legal and lived equality among LGBT and non-LGBT people.</p>
