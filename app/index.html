                    <h1><a>Introduction</a></h1>

                    <p>Public opinion on LGBT issues has shifted over the years.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>At the same time, statewide employment protections have stagnated. In the last 5 years, no new states have passed laws protecting LGBT employees from discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>The 29 states that do not provide protections largely cluster in the Midwestern, Mountain and Southern Regions of the country.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>Social climates are less accepting toward LGBT people in regions where few states have implemented laws that prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>Employment protections and regional differences are impacting the educational, economic and health realities of LGBT people.</p>

                <div class="ethnicity chapter">
                    <h1><a>Ethnicity</a></h1>

                    <p>63% of the LGBT population lives in the Midwest, Mountain and Southern regions of the country.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>Within each region, the LGBT population largely reflects the same race and ethnic composition as the non-LGBT population.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>Notably, African-American LGBT individuals are more likely to live in the 29 states that do not offer employment protections. About 900,000 LGBT people living in states without employment protections are African-American.</p>

                <div class="education chapter">
                    <h1><a>Education</a></h1>

                    <p>Researchers have hypothesized that LGBT people may intentionally pursue higher education as a way to buffer themselves against discrimination in the workplace.</p>

                    <p>However, more LGBT individuals maintain higher levels of college completion in the 21 states with protections than in the 29 states where they might need education to prevent discrimination the most.</p>

                    <p>Researchers have hypothesized that LGBT people may intentionally pursue higher education as a way to buffer themselves against discrimination in the workplace.</p>

                    <p>As it stands, LGBT individuals maintain higher levels of college completion in the 21 protective states than in the 29 states where they might need education to prevent discrimination the most.</p>
                    <!-- <a class="show-me"></a> -->

                    <p>The Midwest region reports the lowest rates of college completion among LGBT people. The Mountain and Southern states are not too far behind.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>The Midwest is also one of the only regions where non-LGBT individuals are more likely to have a college degree than their LGBT counterpart.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                </div>

                <div class="economic-insecurity chapter">
                    <h1><a>Economic Insecurity</a></h1>
                    <p>Employment protections are closely tied to economic security and well-being.</p>

                    <p>LGBT people in the 29 states without protections are more likely to report household incomes below $24,000 than those living in the 21 states where workers are protected.</p>

                    <p>Poverty gaps are at their highest in the Midwest and Mountain states, where LGBT individuals are almost 1.5 times more likely to have incomes below $24,000 than non-LGBT people.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>LGBT people also consistently report not having enough money for food at higher rates than non-LGBT people. Particularly in the Mountain and Southern states.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                </div>

                <div class="health chapter">
                    <h1><a>Health</a></h1>
                    <p>Across the U.S., LGBT people report significant financial constraints on healthcare. This is particularly true for Midwest, Mountain and Southern states.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>Given higher rates of poverty and food insecurity and lack of money for healthcare, it is not surprising that LGBT people in these regions are also less likely to have health insurance.</p>
                    <!-- <a class="show-me"></a> -->

                    <p>More new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) have come from the South than any other region in the country.Â Southern LGBT individuals also have the lowest insurance rates in the country, with nearly one in four individuals lacking insurance.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>

                    <p>MSM in the Mountain states currently have the highest incidence of HIV in the country, at 61.6 new infections per 100,000 MSM. They also have the greatest disparity among the regional population as a whole. The new HIV infection rate among MSM is nearly six times the regional population rate, and the MSM HIV prevalence is more than 50 times the regional population prevalence.</p>
                    <a class="show-me"></a>
                </div>

                <div class="conclusion chapter">
                    <h1><a>Conclusion</a></h1>

                    <p>Legal and social differences across states and regions are likely both the cause and effect of the disparities in economics, education and health.</p>

                    <p>While Southern LGBT people face disparities compared to their non-LGBT counterparts, our analyses also indicate that many of the greatest disparities are found in the Midwest and Mountain states.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, the social climate of each region brings its own assets and challenges to achieving legal and lived equality among LGBT and non-LGBT people.</p>
